# Exploring Python GUI Frameworks

I'm learning about Python GUI frameworks, first via [18 hours of tkinter][cctut]
and moving on through [the simplilearn 2023 top 7][sltop]. Other frameworks like
[PyQt][qtdoc], [Kivy][kvdoc], [PySide][psdoc], [wxPython][wxdoc], [PyGTK][gtdoc],
and [Pyforms][fmdoc] will be covered later. Of course, [tkinter][tkdoc] also has
an official site.

## Prerequisites

Depending on the framework in question, different packages will be installed.

 - tkinter
 - ttkbootstrap # suggestion from the first segment

## Organization

Probably one subfolder will be used per framework, although all packages will be
in the same virtual environment. Each subfolder also has a README.md, with links
to additional sites I found useful for that particular framework/project.
