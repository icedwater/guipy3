# Clear Case's Python GUI Tutorials

Working along with an 18-hour long [YouTube video][vid] which covers many Python
GUI packages, starting with tkinter. Just to figure out how things work.

## Prerequisites

Depending on the framework in question, certain packages will be installed.

 - tkinter
 - ttkbootstrap # suggestion from the first segment

## Organization

Probably one subfolder will be used per framework, although all packages will be
in the same virtual environment.
